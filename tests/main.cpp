#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"

/*
    Exactly one source file must #define either CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN or CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER before
   #include-ing Catch.
    In this file do not write any test cases!
    In most cases that means this file will just contain two lines (the #define and the #include).
